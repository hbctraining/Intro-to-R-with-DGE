### Description
This repository has teaching materials for a **3-day**, hands-on **Introduction to R and differential gene expression (DGE) analysis** workshop. The workshop will introduce participants to the basics of R and RStudio and their application to differential gene expression analysis on RNA-seq count data.

R is a simple programming environment that enables the effective handling of data, while providing excellent graphical support. RStudio is a tool that provides a user-friendly environment for working with R. Together, R and RStudio allow participants to wrangle data, plot, and use DESeq2 to obtain lists of differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq count data.

This workshop is intended to provide both basic R programming knowledge AND its application. Participants should be interested in:

- using R for increasing their efficiency for data analysis
- visualizing data using R (ggplot2)
- using R to perform statistical analysis on RNA-seq count data to obtain differentially expressed gene lists

### Learning Objectives

1. **R syntax**: Understand the different 'parts of speech'.
2. **Data types structures in R**: Describe the various data types and data structures.
3. **Data inspection and wrangling**: Demonstrate the utilization of functions and indices to inspect and subset data from various data structures.
4. **Visualizing data**: Demonstrate the use of the ggplot2 package to create plots for easy data visualization.
5. **Differential expression analysis for RNA-seq data:**
    - Perform QC on count data
    - Use DESeq2 to obtain a list of significantly differentially expressed genes
    - Visualize expression patterns of differentially expressed genes
    - Perform functional analysis on gene lists with R-based tools

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
